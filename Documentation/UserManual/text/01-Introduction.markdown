Introduction
============

This is the GitX user's manual. In this document, you will be able to read
about everything you need to know on how to use GitX.

Requirements
------------

GitX is made specifically for Mac OS X 10.5 and higher. Because it uses
features like Garbage Collection, you can't compile it on earlier systems.
GitX also requires a fairly recent Git -- anything higher than v1.5.3 should
do.
