User Manual
-----------

This is the GitX user's manual. We try to document the most-commonly used 
features here and explain concepts that might be confusing if you've never used 
a git-gui.

### Disclaimer

GitX aims to be a graphical wrapper around the most-frequently used 
git-commands, enabling you to satisfy your daily git needs in one consistent 
program. GitX doesn't aspire to be a complete interface for the wide variety of 
git command-line programs with their ever-growing number of options. It's also 
no easy way to learn git. A sound understanding of how git stores data, how it 
works on that data and how to recover from (accidental) deletion of branches 
and commits will not only help you with git but will also enable you to learn 
GitX with greater confidence and speed. Since GitX is far from complete you'll 
probably still have to use it in conjunction with the command-line git for more 
complex tasks.
