User Manual
-----------

This is the GitX user's manual. In this document, you will be able to read
about everything you need to know on how to use GitX.

### Disclaimer

GitX aims to be a graphical wrapper around the most-frequently used 
git-commands, enabling you to satisfy your daily git needs in one consistent 
program. GitX doesn't aspire to be a complete interface for the wide variety of 
git command-line programs with their ever-growing number of options. It's also 
no easy way to learn git. A sound understanding of how git stores data, how it 
works on that data and how to recover from (accidental) deletion of branches 
and commits will not only help you with git but will also enable you to learn 
GitX with greater confidence and speed.
