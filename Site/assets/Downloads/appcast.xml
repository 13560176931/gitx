          <h1>GitX 0.6.1</h1>
          <div style='font-size: 70%'>
            <p>This is a bugfix release. The following bugs have been fixed:</p>

            <ul>
            <li>The commit view shows new files with linebreaks</li>
            <li>The history view works with Git >= 1.5.4 again</li>
            <li>Reloading the detailed view in the History no longer causes an empty page</li>
            </ul>

          <p>Version 0.6 has the following new features and enhancements:</p>

          <ul>
          <li>The diff display now looks much nicer, using boxes to segment files</li>
          <li>The toolbar can now me customized</li>
          <li>Images that have been changed or added in a commit can now be viewed
          inline in GitX</li>
          <li>GitX has gained a preference pane which allows you to specify a git path
          and disable the Gist and Gravatar integration</li>
          <li>The commit interface is now more intuitive. Particularly, you can now
          select multiple files and use drag and drop to stage / unstage files</li>
          <li>You can now drag and drop files out of the commit view</li>
          <li>The files in the commit view have gained a context menu that allows you
          to revert changes / open the file / ignore the file</li>
          <li>It is now possible to adjust the amount of context lines in the commit view.
          Using a smaller context size allows you to do more fine-grained commits</li>
          <li>The branch menu is now organized in branches/remotes/tags</li>
          <li>The view switch button now uses icons rather than words</li>
          <li>The view shortcuts have changed to use command 1/2 for the history/commit 
          view. The history&#8217;s subviews can now be changed using command-option-1/2/3</li>
          <li>Listing commits has become much faster</li>
          <li>GitX no longer spawns zombie processes</li>
          <li>GitX now shows a list of files that have been changed in a commit</li>
          <li>GitX now uses libgit2 to store object id&#8217;s, reducing it&#8217;s memory footprint</li>
          </ul>

          <p>In addition many bugs were fixed, including the correct calculation of a
          gravatar MD5 hash.</p>
